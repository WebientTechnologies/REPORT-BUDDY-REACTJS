The closest report of damage due to atornado was damage to XXXX in City, State,approximately X miles northeast of the subjectproperty. No information regarding the intensityof the reported tornado in City, State wasavailable.
            
We also reviewed several other weather datawebsites owned by NOAA to obtain informationregarding the reported tornado. No informationrelevant to the reported tornado event could beobtained from these websites.Several media websites reported that on MonthDate, Year, at least three tornadoes passedthrough the City, State area causing structuraldamage. The media reported that an EF2tornado [on the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale]touched down in City, State, which wasapproximately 8 miles northeast of the subjectproperty.

The EF Scale is used to assign a 'rating' fortornadoes based on estimated wind speeds andrelated damage. When tornado-related damageis surveyed, it is compared to a list of DamageIndicators (DIs) and Degrees of Damage (DoD)which help estimate better the range of windspeeds the tornado likely produced. From that, arating (EF0 to EF5) is assigned. The wind speedsassociated with the EF scale are provided in thebelow table.
